# Practice Repository

This Repository exists as a Tutorium reference for the usage of the Tiled/Tileson workflow of your projects.
This implements @SquidSushi's original TilesetDrawer and shows off a few additional features of Tiled/Tileson you might want to implement, such as Tile animations.

Feel free to use this as a Template to create your own playground.
